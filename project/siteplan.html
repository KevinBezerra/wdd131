            <h2>1. Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Age of Empires II Compendium.</strong></p>
            <p>I chose this name because it clearly communicates the site's purpose: to be a comprehensive collection of information about the game "Age of Empires II". The word "Compendium" suggests a detailed and authoritative resource, which aligns with the goal of providing structured data about the game's civilizations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The primary purpose of this website is to provide a user-friendly, dynamic, and responsive resource for players of Age of Empires II. The site will serve as a hub for players to quickly access and filter information about the game's many civilizations.</p>
            <p>The site will provide the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A filterable gallery of civilizations, dynamically generated from a data source.</li>
                <li>Detailed information on each civilization, including their focus, unique units, and unique technologies.</li>
                <li>A contact form for user feedback and inquiries, as required for the final project.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Unit Counters</h2>
            <p>A core aspect of Age of Empires II strategy is the "rock-paper-scissors" system, where specific unit types are designed to be strong against others. The website will provide detailed information on these relationships to help players make better strategic decisions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Pikemen counter Cavalry because pikemen are a cost-effective infantry unit that receives a large attack bonus against cavalry units." </li>
                <li>"Skirmishers counter Archers because skirmishers have high "pierce armor," which significantly reduces the damage they take from archer attacks. They also receive an attack bonus against archer-type units, allowing them to effectively trade and win battles against more expensive archers." </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Color Schema</h2>
            <p>The color scheme is designed to evoke a medieval, strategic feel, reminiscent of the game itself. The colors will be applied to this document as required.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Royal Blue (`#0A2342`):</strong> This will be the primary color used for headings, the footer background, and major UI elements like buttons. It conveys a sense of authority and strategy.</li>
                <li><strong>Antique Gold (`#B9975B`):</strong> This will serve as the accent color for links, button hover effects, and important highlights. It provides a classic, high-value contrast.</li>
                <li><strong>Parchment (`#F4F1DE`):</strong> This light, off-white color will be used for the main background of the site, creating a readable and thematic canvas for the content.</li>
                <li><strong>Charcoal (`#2C2C2C`):</strong> This dark gray will be used for the body text to ensure high readability against the parchment background.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Typography</h2>
            <p>The typography choices aim to balance thematic feel with modern web readability. I have selected two fonts for this project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cinzel (Serif):</strong> This font has a classic, almost chiseled look, perfect for the game's historical theme. It will be used for all main headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`).</li>
                <li><strong>Lato (Sans-serif):</strong> This font is clean, modern, and highly readable, making it ideal for all body text, including paragraphs, lists, and form labels.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
